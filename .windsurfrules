# JobChain - scalable AI job scheduling and execution platform

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context
JobChain allows users to execute AI and IO Job graphs in parallel.

## Architecture
Always read the architecture document in the root folder: ARCHITECTURE.md, before undertaking any task.  You are allowed to update this document with any observations you have made. If you do upate the ARCHITECTURE.md, then put *** ARCHITECTURE UPDATE *** in the output.

## Tests
- execute unit tests in the root directory using pytest using the command `python -m pytest` as the root of your test commands.
- use pytest's --full-suite flag to run all tests, including performance tests.
- when running tests that are logging in order to investigate causes the use `python -m pytest -s` to see the logs. Just using "-v" will not show the logs.

## Code Editing Disciplines
- NEVER jump to conclusions, always confirm for yourself what the facts are, even if I have told you what my understanding is, confirm for yourself your assumptions with direct observations from logging or prints, before making changes.
- add logging or prints freely to help you confirm what the facts are before making changes.
- Base decisions on the evidence you see in command outputs and results or tests.
- Use straightforward approaches first.
- Break complex problems into simpler pieces.
- Test each piece separately.

## Code Style and Structure
- write clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code.
- test code for correctness and performance. 
- prioritize readability,simplicity, and performance.
- use type hints and annotations where possible.
- use appropriate error handling and input validation.
- structure code into functions and classes for modularity and reusability.
- never delete any of the TODOs or comments that I have put in the code as explainers, unless the code logic or variable names have changed.

## Logging
For logging, use the jobchain.jc_logging module, not the standard logging module.
- for external files, examples and tests use
`import jobchain.jc_logging as logging` 
- for internal files under /src use the relative path import of jc_logging
- WINDSURF AI AGENT ONLY: set the WINDSURF_LOG_FLAG="DEBUG" jc_logging.py to activate debug logging.
- OTHER AI AGENTS: to activate debug logging in tests do `JOBCHAIN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python -m pytest -v -s`

## Command Macros
When I ask you to run a macro do the following:
- SWITCH_TO_ANALYSE_LINKEDIN:
```bash
cd /Users/davidroberts/projects/apps/AnalyseLinkedIn/
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- SWITCH_TO_JOBCHAIN:
```bash
cd /Users/davidroberts/projects/JobChain/
source .venv/bin/activate
```
