## Clarification and Improvements

While working with the Flow4AI API, I've identified several areas for clarification and potential improvements:

### Clarifications Needed

1.  **Error Handling**: The documentation could better explain how job errors are propagated and handled. The `execute` method raises exceptions, but what happens when using `submit` and `wait_for_completion`?
2.  **Task Parameters vs. Job Names**: The naming convention for task parameters is unclear. Sometimes parameters use dot notation (e.g., `"square.x": 5`), and other times they don't (e.g., `"start": 1`). When should each format be used?
3.  **FQ_Name Generation**: The rules for generating fully qualified names (FQ names) could be clearer. How does collision detection and resolution work when adding multiple DSLs with the same graph name and variant?
4.  **Return Value Processing**: There's inconsistency in how return values are accessed. Sometimes through `result["result"]`, sometimes from saved results like `result["SAVED_RESULTS"]["job_name"]`.
5.  **Context Variable Usage**: The documentation could provide more examples of accessing the job context (`j_ctx`) and explain all the available properties.
6.  **Handling Timeouts**: The behaviour when tasks exceed the timeout in `wait_for_completion` could be clearer. Are results partial or lost entirely?
7.  **Multiple Submit Behaviour**: When submitting multiple tasks with the same DSL, are they processed in parallel or sequentially? How is this affected by the implementation (async vs threading)?

### Potential Improvements

1.  **Consistent Result Access API**: Standardize how results are accessed from jobs. Consider a more intuitive API for retrieving results.
2.  **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Provide more detailed error information, including stack traces and the context in which errors occurred.
3.  **Progress Monitoring**: Add methods to monitor the progress of long-running tasks, not just completion status.
4.  **Interactive Dashboards**: Implement web-based dashboards for visualizing job graphs and their execution status.
5.  **DSL Validation**: Add more robust validation of DSL components before execution to catch configuration errors early.
6.  **Result Streaming**: Allow streaming of results as they become available rather than waiting for all tasks to complete.
7.  **Persistent Job Graphs**: Support serialization and persistence of job graphs for reuse across application restarts.
8.  **Type Annotations**: Enhance type annotations throughout the codebase to improve IDE support and catch type-related errors earlier.
9.  **Cancellation Support**: Add the ability to cancel submitted tasks that are still pending or in progress.
10. **Documentation Improvements**:
    -   Add more code examples for common patterns
    -   Document all parameters for each method
    -   Create diagrams showing the lifecycle of tasks and jobs
    -   Provide performance tips and best practices
11. **Synchronous API Option**: Consider providing a simpler synchronous API for cases where asynchronous execution isn't needed.
12. **Execution Hooks**: Add pre/post execution hooks at the job and graph levels for cross-cutting concerns like logging and metrics.
