1.  **Error Handling**: ✅ Errors within jobs are caught and retrievable via `pop_results()`. `execute()` raises exceptions for these. `on_complete` callback errors are not caught by `FlowManager`.
2.  **Task Parameters vs. Job Names**: ✅ Short-form (dot notation) and long-form (nested dicts) are supported, with `args`/`kwargs` for callables.
3.  **DSL Transformation**: ✅ `add_dsl` -> `dsl_to_precedence_graph` (handles `>>`, `|`, `p()`, `s()`) -> `validate_graph` -> `JobFactory.create_job_graph` (with auto default head/tail).
4.  **FQ_Name Generation and Collision Handling**: ✅ `JobABC.create_FQName` used; `FlowManager` handles same-object DSL re-addition and uses `find_unique_variant_suffix` for different DSLs with clashing names/variants.
5.  **Return Value Processing**: ✅ Results primarily from tail job, with `RETURN_JOB`, `TASK_PASSTHROUGH_KEY`, and `SAVED_RESULTS` (keyed by short names) providing additional context.
6.  **Graph Validation**: ✅ `validate_graph` checks cycles, references, head/tail nodes. `JobFactory` adds default head/tail jobs.
7.  **Handling Timeouts**: ✅ `FlowManager.wait_for_completion(timeout=X)` is a top-level timeout. `JobABC.timeout` is for individual jobs awaiting inputs.
8.  **Multiple Submit Behavior (`FlowManager`)**: ✅ Uses `asyncio` for concurrent (not parallel) execution on a single event loop.

### Potential Improvements

1.  **Consistent Result Access API**: While the structure is now clearer (tail job output vs. `SAVED_RESULTS`), a more streamlined API or helper methods to access specific job outputs could improve usability.
2.  **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Provide more structured error objects in `pop_results()['errors']`, perhaps including the FQ name of the job that failed and more context. The current `execute()` method consolidates errors into a single string, which could be improved.
3.  **Progress Monitoring**: Implement ways to query the status of submitted tasks (e.g., pending, running, percentage complete for long jobs if feasible).
4.  **Interactive Dashboards**: Leverage `graph_pic.py` or similar to create dynamic, web-based visualizations of graph structures and their live execution status.
5.  **DSL Visualization**: Integrate `graph_pic.py` more directly to allow users to easily visualize the graph derived from their DSL, aiding in debugging and understanding.
6.  **Result Streaming**: For long-running jobs or graphs, allow results (or partial results/status updates) to be streamed back as they become available, rather than only via `pop_results()` after `wait_for_completion()`.
7.  **Persistent Job Graphs**: Allow `FlowManager` to serialize its `job_map` (including graph structures) and reload it, to persist defined workflows across sessions.
8.  **Type Annotations & Pydantic Integration**: Continue enhancing type annotations. The use of Pydantic models for job properties (as seen in `OpenAIJob` with `response_format`) is good; expand this for clearer configuration schemas.
9.  **Task Cancellation**: Implement a mechanism to cancel tasks that have been submitted but are not yet complete, or are long-running. This would likely involve `asyncio.Task.cancel()`.
10. **Documentation Improvements**:
    *   More detailed examples for `add_dsl_dict` and graph/variant management.
    *   Clearer explanation of the `JobABC.timeout` (input wait timeout) vs. `FlowManager.wait_for_completion()` timeout.
    *   Best practices for writing `on_complete` callbacks, especially regarding error handling within them.
11. **Synchronous API Wrapper**: For simple use cases or integration with synchronous codebases, a synchronous wrapper around `FlowManager` might be beneficial, though the core remains async.
12. **Execution Hooks/Middleware**: Allow users to register functions that are called at various lifecycle stages (e.g., before/after job run, on task submission/completion) for metrics, logging, or custom logic.
13. **Parameter Validation**: `WrappingJob._validate_params` checks if provided args/kwargs can be bound to the callable's signature. This could be extended, or a pre-submission validation step could be added.
14. **Graph Optimization**: For complex graphs, explore possibilities for static analysis and optimization (e.g., merging compatible jobs, reordering independent branches).
15. **Job-Specific Timeouts**: Allow individual `JobABC` instances to define an execution timeout for their `run` method, distinct from the input-wait timeout.
16. **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement configurable retry policies (e.g., number of retries, backoff strategy) for jobs that might fail due to transient issues.
17. **Dynamic Graph Modification**: (Advanced) Explore safe ways to allow modification of a loaded graph structure, though this adds significant complexity.
18. **Granular `save_result` Control**: Instead of a boolean `save_result`, allow specifying *which* output keys from a job should be saved to `SAVED_RESULTS` to reduce memory footprint.
19. **Context Propagation Control**: Provide more explicit mechanisms to control how context (accessed via `j_ctx` or `self.get_context()`) is shared or isolated, especially across parallel branches or within sub-graphs.
20. **Standardized Job Configuration Schema**: While `jobs.yaml` allows arbitrary `properties`, defining a more standardized schema for common job configurations (e.g., API keys, resource limits) could improve consistency. The `OpenAIJob`'s structured `properties` (client, api, rate_limit) is a good example.
21. **Plugin System for Job Types**: Formalize `JobFactory.register_job_type` into a more discoverable plugin system, perhaps using entry points, for easier extension by users.
22. **Improved DSL Error Messages**: When DSL syntax is incorrect or leads to an invalid graph structure during `dsl_to_precedence_graph`, provide more user-friendly error messages that pinpoint the issue within the DSL expression.
23. **Async Resource Management in Jobs**: Offer guidance or helper utilities for managing asynchronous resources (like `aiohttp.ClientSession`) within `JobABC.run()` methods, ensuring they are properly acquired and released, especially when jobs are part of a larger application. The `OpenAIClient` singleton is one pattern for managing shared clients.
