# JobChain Graph Visualization Features

This document tracks the implementation status of graph visualization features for the JobChain project.

## Working Process

Implement graph visualization features in small chunks:
1) Create each feature one at a time
2) Run visual tests to verify the feature works as expected
3) Fix any issues with the feature
4) Mark the feature as completed or note any issues
5) Move on to the next feature

## Implementation Status Legend

- [x] Feature fully implemented and working
- [!] Feature implemented but has issues (see notes)
- [ ] Feature not implemented
- [~] Feature skipped (see explanation)

## Graph Visualization Features

### Must-Have Features

1. **Hierarchical Layout Improvements**
   - [ ] Refined node positioning for clearer hierarchical structure
   - [ ] Better horizontal spacing between levels
   - [ ] Improved vertical alignment within levels
   - [ ] Enhanced handling of complex graph structures

2. **Complex Graph Examples**
   - [ ] Diamond-shaped dependency example
   - [ ] Multi-path example with branches and merges
   - [ ] Large-scale graph example (20+ nodes)
   - [ ] Disconnected sub-graphs example

### Great-to-Have Features

3. **Node Coloring and Status Visualization**
   - [ ] Coloring nodes based on job status (e.g., pending, running, completed, failed)
   - [ ] Custom color schemes for different job types
   - [ ] Gradient coloring based on numeric attributes
   - [ ] Legend for color meanings

### Good-to-Have Features

4. **Jupyter Notebook Integration**
   - [ ] Direct rendering in Jupyter cells
   - [ ] Interactive toggles for layout algorithms
   - [ ] Zoom and pan capabilities in notebook
   - [ ] Export visualization from notebook

5. **Custom Node Styling**
   - [ ] Different node shapes for different job types
   - [ ] Variable node sizes based on attributes
   - [ ] Custom node borders and effects
   - [ ] Text styling options for node labels

### Nice-to-Have Features

6. **Edge Styling Options**
   - [ ] Different line styles for different dependency types
   - [ ] Edge weight visualization
   - [ ] Edge labels for additional information
   - [ ] Custom arrow styles

7. **Export and Saving Options**
   - [ ] Save to various image formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
   - [ ] Export as interactive HTML
   - [ ] Copy visualization to clipboard
   - [ ] Batch export for multiple graphs

## Implementation Notes

- Current graph visualization is functional but the hierarchical layout needs refinement
- Arrows have been improved but could be further enhanced
- Need to test with more complex graph structures to verify layout algorithm effectiveness

## Testing Strategy

For each feature:
1. Create a dedicated test script that demonstrates the feature
2. Include multiple test cases with varying complexity
3. Compare visual output with expected results
4. Document any limitations or issues
