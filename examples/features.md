# LiteLLM Features

This document tracks the implementation status of LiteLLM features in our examples.

## Working Process ##

Create the LiteLLM examples in small chunks, 
1) Create each example one at a time,
2) then run the example, to check that it works, 
3) then fix the example
4) If you can't fix the example after three tries, mark it in features.md as "can't fix" and move on to the next example.
5) If the example is working mark it as completed.
6) Move on to the next example.

## Implementation Status Legend

- [x] Feature fully implemented and working
- [!] Feature implemented but has issues (see notes)

## Implementation Notes
- Features marked with [x] are fully implemented and working correctly in the examples.
- Features marked with [!] are implemented but have known issues (like missing API keys) that need to be addressed.
- Features marked with [~] are skipped due to complexity, external dependencies, or infrastructure requirements.
- The implemented examples cover the core functionalities of LiteLLM that can be demonstrated in standalone examples.
- To use examples with [!] status, add the required API keys to the api.env file.
