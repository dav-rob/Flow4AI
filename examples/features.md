# <task> Features

This document tracks the implementation status of <task> features in our features.

## Working Process ##

Create the <task> features in small chunks, 
1) Create each feature one at a time,
2) then run the feature, to check that it works, 
3) then fix the feature
4) If you can't fix the feature after three tries, mark it in features.md as "can't fix" and move on to the next feature.
5) If the feature is working mark it as completed.
6) Move on to the next feature.

## Implementation Status Legend

- [x] Feature fully implemented and working
- [!] Feature implemented but has issues (see notes)

## Implementation Notes
- Features marked with [x] are fully implemented and working correctly in the features.
- Features marked with [!] are implemented but have known issues (like missing API keys) that need to be addressed.
- Features marked with [~] are skipped due to complexity, external dependencies, or infrastructure requirements.
- The implemented features cover the core functionalities of <task> that can be demonstrated in standalone features.
- To use features with [!] status, add the required API keys to the api.env file.
